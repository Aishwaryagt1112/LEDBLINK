LEDBLINK Task
This repository contains my implementation of the LEDBLINK task using Keil uVision4 during my internship. This project showcases my programming skills and understanding of embedded systems and microcontroller applications.

Overview
The LEDBLINK functionality demonstrates how to control an LED to blink at specified intervals using a microcontroller. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with the Keil uVision4 IDE and develop critical troubleshooting skills.

Key Highlights
Developed and implemented code for LED blinking functionality.
Gained practical experience with the Keil uVision4 IDE for embedded software development.
Collaborated with team members to troubleshoot and optimize code for efficiency.
Skills Acquired
Embedded Systems Development
Microcontroller Programming
Code Optimization and Troubleshooting
I'm excited to share this project and look forward to applying these skills in future endeavors!
